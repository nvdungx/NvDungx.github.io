**About me:** Love football both playing and watching, riding motorcycle, admiring beautiful sceneries around my country. Had been working as embedded engineer in automotive domain for over 5 years.  

**Education:** graduated from Ho Chi Minh city Bach Khoa University in Jan-2017. I studied electronic and electrical engineering and major in Automation & Control Engineering.  
During my time at the university, even though most of my courses were focused on factory automation(SCADA, PLC, Industrial Networking), my interest shifted to embedded domain(robotic).
With foundational knowledge in Control engineering, some online self-studied embedded, robotic courses and a lot of reading, googling, I was able to finish a project and thesis on:
1. [PID Motor Control](https://link)
2. [Delta Robot](https://link)  

**Profession Experiences:**
1. AUTOSAR MCAL Software Engineer (RCAR Gen3 SOC)
2. AUTOSAR ASW Software Developer (Commercial Vehicle ECU - Signal Actuation Module)
3. Senior Embedded Software Engineer (EV AC&DC Charging Station and Passenger EV Power Electronic ECU - Charger & Power Distribution Unit)
