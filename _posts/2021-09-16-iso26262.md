# GENERAL

Safety is one of the key issues in automotive software development.
 New functionalities such as ADAS, propulsion, vehicle dynamic control, active and passive safety system
 increasingly required safety practices.  
With the trend of increasing technological complexity in automotive software implementation, there are risks of systematic failures.
And ISO26262 standard address these specific needs (avoiding risk, prevent or mitigate damages) by:
- provide references for the automotive safety lifecycle, i.e. activities to be performed during development, production, operation, service and decommissioning.
- provide an automotive-specific risk based approach to determine integrity level(ASIL).
- provide requirements for functional safety management, design, implementation, verification, validation and confirmation measures.

# APPROACH

The framework for functional safety to apply to a development of safety related system shall has following phase:
> NOTE: these are some of the phases that provide input information directly or indirectly to software development (there are other phases in ISO26262 that specify safety management, hardware, production,..).  
> ISO26262 specify what and how(not all) safety should be performed in an automotive EE product development.

## 1. CONCEPT PHASE
**1. item definition:** define target items follow functional behavior at the vehicle level, potential behavior shortfall, hazards,...  
**2. hazard analysis and risk assessment:** evaluate the hazardous event(from items definition) by consider its severity, probability of exposure, controllability to create *safety goal* and *their corresponding ASIL*.  
Safety goals are top-level safety requirement for items, they lead to the functional safety requirements and express in term of functional objective.  
**3. functional safety concept:** contains safety measures, including the safety mechanisms, to be implemented in the itemâ€™s architectural elements and *specified in the functional safety requirements*.

**Functional safety requirement's content should address:**
- the parameters monitored by the system components are validated and correct.
- the actions taken by the system components are correct and confirmed
- in case of a hazardous event, the system components are transit to the correct safe sate with in correct time.
- the driver is properly informed.
- when a fault requiring transition to a safe sate is detected, appropriate diagnostic trouble codes are set
 and data are logged such as the actual time required to reach the defined safe state.

## 2. SYSTEM LEVEL
  At the system level, technical safety concept is developed, incorporating technical safety requirements and the system architectural design.

**1. technical safety concept:**
  Technical safety concept shall take input from functional safety concept and system architectural design to specify technical safety requirements.
  - to specify technical safety requirements regarding the functionality, dependencies, constraints and properties of the system.
  - to specify safety mechanisms to be implemented in the system.

**2. technical safety requirements:**
  Specify the stimulus *response(detect faults and prevent/mitigate failures) of the system* to achieve safety requirement (*safety mechanism*).  
  Safety mechanism including:
  - detection, indication and control of faults in the system itself (self-monitoring to detect random hardware faults, detection and control of communication channel failures).
  - detection, indication and control of faults in other external elements that interact with the system.
  - define and implement the warning and degradation strategy.
  - mechanism to achieve or maintain the safe state.
  - mechanism to prevent faults from being latent.

**3. system architectural design:**
  The technical safety requirements shall be allocated to the system architectural design elements with system, hardware or software.  
  Each system architectural design element shall inherit the highest ASIL from the technical safety requirements that it implements.

**4. allocation to hardware and software:**
  Technical safety requirements shall be allocated to the hardware or software elements.
  The hardware-software interface specification shall specify the hardware and software interaction and be consistent with the technical safety concept.  
  HSI elements can be considered: memory, bus interfaces, converter, I/O, watchdog(internal/external), multiplexer.

## 3. SOFTWARE LEVEL

### 1. Inputs and Objectives
- technical safety concept, technical safety requirements, system architectural design, hardware-software interface specification shall be used to define software safety requirements
- qualified software tools to be used in software development.
- design and coding guidelines for modelling, design and programming languages
- ensure a suitable and consistent software development process and software development environment.

### 2. Specification of software safety requirements
- specify the software requirements, which are derived from technical safety concept and system architecture design.
- define safety-related functionalities and properties to be implemented
- define requirements of the hardware-software interface

### 3. Software Architecture design
- software architecture design represents the software architecture elements and their interactions, other aspects such as interfaces, processes sequence, timing behavior are also described.
- develop a software architectural design that satisfies the software safety requirements and the other software requirements.
- verify that the software architecture design is suitable to satisfy the software safety requirements with the required ASIL.

### 4. Software Unit design and implementation
- develop software unit design in accordance with the software architecture design (detailed design can be represented in the form of a model).
- implement software unit, implementation at the source code level can be manually or automatically generated.

### 5. Software Unit verification
- provide evidence that the software unit design satisfies the allocated software requirements and is suitable for the implementation.
- provide evidence that the implemented software unit complies with the unit design and fulfils the allocated software requirements with the required ASIL.
- verify that the defined safety measures resulting from safety-oriented analyses are properly implemented.

### 6. Software Integration and verification
- define the integration steps and integrate the software elements until the embedded software is fully integrated.
- verify that the defined safety measures resulting from safety analyses are properly implemented.
- provide evidence that the integrated software units and software components fulfil their requirements.

### 7. Testing of embedded software
- fulfils the software safety requirements when executed in the target environment.
